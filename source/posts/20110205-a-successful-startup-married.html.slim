  |It could be argued that finding your business partner is no different than being lucky enough to find the right
    person for you.  I can not begin to share with you, just how many failures I have had at this game, but this
    time I got it right.  In the startup of life I have made one of the best decisions I ever could have made.

      author: "Chris and Kate Hough",\
      quote: "Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>Finding your soulmate in this world is quite a challenge. It’s something that takes time and lots of searching. It also takes a great understanding of who you are, what you want in another person, and where you want to go in this world. The search comes not without diversions and challenges, but in the end, it is one of the most amazing things you can do in this life.<br/><br/>Chris and Kate are very excited to announce a very happy surprise.  We decided to get married! We have been talking about getting married for quite sometime, and we decided not to wait. We met on February 8, 2010 in Boulder, CO, and we were married on February 5, 2011 in Queens, NY.<br/><br/>The whole event was very New York and we did it just like you would expect. Kate is low maintenance (the opposite of a bridezilla) – shebought her wedding dress from Macy’s in Herald Square. We also had our rings handcrafted by an artisan from Massachusetts. We had cakefrom Magnolia Bakery, one of the most famous bakeries in the city!  For the ceremony, we were accompanied by a non-denominational pastorand a witness –that’s it! We are very excited that our lives have brought us together in NYC and we hope to enjoy a few exciting years together as newlyweds before were expand our family.<br/><br/>We are lucky to have you all as supportive friends and family in just about every time zone.  Because of this, we are going to celebrate our marriage with you all next year, for our first wedding anniversary. We’re planning on making a few stops across the country to celebrate this good news.<br/><br/>We will be sending announcements to our close friends and family in the coming weeks with more info and pictures.<br/><br/> Lots of love"}
