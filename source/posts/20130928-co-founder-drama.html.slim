  |If you are single founder or a team seeking help, I hope our experience helps you avoid the pitfalls we encountered when taking on a co-founder. While we always hear of the huge wins like the Twitter IPO, the ground is littered with failed ideas, relationships, and puddles of tears.  If you have followed my posts you already know I am brutally honest. Proceed with caution:  I am no expert. This is our first business, and we understand there is never a guarantee for success in entrepreneurship.  These life lessons learned this past summer, these “stupid taxes,” are the scars that help us remember to never make the same mistake twice.  Before I can express the lessons we learned, let me tell you the story.

  |My wife and I have been building a business for over a year now.  We both work full time, and unfortunately we both have school debt. Like any idea, we pivoted a few times into different industries and we are primarily interested in growing lean without venture capital if at all possible.  You may refer to this as a side project, which everyone in technology nowadays has one. Our baby was no different, and this past summer we wanted to ramp up development in areas where our skills were lacking.  I have always been a huge fan of meetups, and regularly started attending the geek hotspots in our community.  As luck would have it, we encountered a great opportunity to bring on a co-founder who was already working with a product in similar market space.  We quickly all became friends and believed it was a match made in heaven.  Instead, it turned out to be a wasted three months and thousands of dollars in stock split and legal fees. So what did we learn?

p
  |<strong>[1] Work ethic</strong> is the single most important factor in evaluating a co-founder and building a team.  If you’re all working full time jobs, agree to a number of hours you expect to work outside of the day job and stick to it.  Measure it.  Building a business takes blood, sweat, and tears.  It takes commitment both to the dream, and the work itself.  If you are the only one <a href="#{post_url("Who's online at 2am?")}">online at 2am</a> this will build resentment, distrust, and disloyalty in the organization.  Trust me on this, if you get the feeling they will not be there with you at the early hours of the morning, they will not be there when bugs arise under tight deadlines. #{link_to("@Jason", "https://twitter.com/jason", target: "_blank")} states this better than I can: <em>“..Startup life, it’s not a game. Don’t work at a startup if you’re not into it–go work at the post office or stabucks if you’re not into it you want balance in your life.”</em>(#{link_to("Source", "http://calacanis.com/2008/03/07/how-to-save-money-running-a-startup-17-really-good-tips/", target: "_blank")} There is nothing wrong with the 9-5, it’s a great life, and not everyone is cutout for startups and building businesses.

  |Tightly coupled to work ethic is <strong>[2] Self-Motivation</strong>. It should be no surprise to you that many business executives are also health and fitness junkies.  They love adrenaline, and they do not need someone on their back to fuel their fire.  It comes from within.  They are capable of digging deep, fighting through the pain, and using their internal energy to break through any obstacle in their path.  I believe each person ofthe founding team needs to have this trait, and it must be part of their dna.  You cannot convince someone to be self motivated so do not waste yourtime, move on to the next better candidate.  The constant headache of dealing with whining and lack of interest will be cumbersome and slow you down.

p
  |If you’ve made it through the work ethic, and past self-motivation, it’s time to talk <strong>[3] Legal and Finances</strong>.  Considering I almost left technology for finance, and we were lucky enough to have a great attorney, we excelled in this area.  When we grew the team we rebalanced the shares so everyone was equal at 25% with 25% percent unallocated.  Our attorney advised against this because we had already been working on the business for over a year, but I believe in being fair.  It was still such an early stage, it made sense to be equal.  Where I did agree with legal was the cliff.  If you do not have a vesting schedule with a 1 year minimum cliff, you are doing it wrong.  In our case, the original team started at the cliff and the new co-founder had to wait 12 months.  This decision ended up saving our ass.  When the co-founder quit the business it was easy to buy back the shares.   Along those lines, we also had provisions baked in giving the corporation first right of refusal to buy back shares at a later date if neccessary. We also had our books in “ocd” like order and every transaction was documented and accounted for since the business was created.  This made the separation much easier, especially considering in our case the separation was voluntary.

p
  |If all of the reasons above have passed with flying colors, it’s time to talk about the <strong>[4] Technology Stack</strong>.  Make sure the new co-founder is versed in the technology stack you are building the project in.  In our case, we had laid the foundation in rails, yet we made the mistake of bringing on a person who had no experience in ruby or rails. They only knew python.  While I have no problems with python, it’s a great language, in a small team it makes more sense to be very familiar with the same sets of technology, at least for the mvp. This caused us multiple headaches and rework because of the lack of knowledge of how ruby on rails worked.  At the same time, make sure you take the time to evaluate the candidate's skill set, especially if you are looking for someone to compliment your own.  If you need Sass and design cutup, inquire up front.  Do not make assumptions, and ask for a portfolio.

p
  |Finally commit to <strong>[5] Measurements</strong> and keep everyone honest.  While we had regularly scheduled project planning meetings, and an agile sprint cycle, we failed to monitor check ins.  Any startup worth a penny makes code commits daily.  This should never be a debate, and not even optional.  If you have made it this far in your evaluation, this part should be assumed, if not laughable.  Stick to your deliverables and track everyone’s progress.  One of our strengths was documentation, we documented everything that was great, and everything that was a failure. While I am sure I can go on and on, these lists are highly variable in nature, and definitely not all inclusive.

  |I hope this has helped you, if at most, sparked a few ideas and concerns in your brain.  Let me reiterate, I am no expert, but I believe in <a href="#{post_url('constant learning')}">constant learning</a>.  I will leave one final thought since I love using analogies.

p
  |Make sure that you surround yourself with A players only if you want to win. The best pirate ship has an A captain, A people firing the cannons, and A people cleaning the deck.  Not everyone is good at controlling the sails. Over the course of its life, not all shipmates will reach the final resting place.  The perfect combination of players and skills will yield the gold and spoils of battle.
