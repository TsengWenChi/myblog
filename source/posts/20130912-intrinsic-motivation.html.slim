  |If you think that technology is a 9 to 5 gig, please stop reading this article right now.  Go back to your couch, crack open a bud, turn on your favorite show, and zone back out.  In fact, take it one step further.  Call a friend over to take a photo of you sitting there aimlessly watching TV.  Mount the photo on your wall because you will be in that same place, withering away, until your time on this wonderful planet expires. Technology, startups, and building businesses are a 24 hours a day job.  It is part of life, and it should be part of your DNA.  To think otherwise is not only naive, it’s quite short cited.  The world is evolving every second regardless of your participation.  I have been on call every day since I started coding, and not a day goes by when I do not feel behind.  Here’s the definition for those that need it.

  |Over the years, I have always wondered what it takes to be successful.  One of my favorite quotes from a <a href="#{post_url("Who's online at 2am?")}">video I wrote about</a>is:

  |I live by this every day, and I have come to accept that not everyone wants it.  People look for reasons, for excuses, or worse yet point blame at the so called 1% for why they are NOT this or that.  The answer is in the mirror, yet many do not want to realize it.  Another favorite rant of mine is from Adam Corolla, when he went off about the occupy wall street movement.

      quote: "There goes Mr. Jenkins. Look up to him. That guy works hard. That guy built a company. That guy built an empire. Now look at him. He’s got his Rolls Royce. He’s drivin’ up the hill.  But what do we do now? Now it’s like: Oh, look at him. Look at him. Does he need that car? Why’s he need that car? I’m drivin’ a fuckin’ Chevette! Why’s he get to drive that fuckin’ car, you know? Let’s go up there and throw a rock at it."}

  |Every day I leave the gym, working to slim down my fat ass and I walk by at least a half dozen one hundred thousand dollar cars.  I’m do not feel jealousy, I feel inspired, I set my goals higher, and push on.  I watched my family work day in and day out.  When I was younger I did not understand why they were gone all the time but as I grew up, and matured the answer was clear.  They realized that in order for me to break free of the chains that restricted their lives they had to make sacrifices.  While I was not the poorest kid in my school growing up, I can say I was certainly towards the bottom.  While I never acted like it, I pretended I lived in a reality far different from what I came home to each day.  Being exposed to options, executives running major businesses, and a hard lined grading scale meant I had little time for error. It instilled a drive in me to succeed that has kept me alive throughout all of the lows in my life.   This passion, my dreams have never faded and while not all of them have come to fruition, many of them have.  It’s how I live. It’s my DNA.  Not too long ago I was asked by a friend if I do everything in my life with 110% effort.  I looked at hime and replied:

  |I was happy to be a part of the generation where many kids did not get trophies for shit they never did, or even lifted a finger to help.  I rode the pine during sports, and I understand what that feels like.  While I am not expert at the game of life, I do understand that I have to play.  When the game is over, I will be dead.  The bigger question I ask myself is whether or not I have accomplished everything I wanted to do.  You see, I believe I am not crazy. I believe that there are others out there who are intrinsically motivated to succeed.  They do not need a carrot on a stick in front of them and they do not care what people think.  They run over the obstacles regardless if they are economic, human, family, friends, or personal holdups.  In life you will rarely encounter these people, and they are often confused or portrayed as workaholics.  Trust me, they are not.  These are the folks that are going to build businesses.  These are the folks that could care less about who won the big game, and are more interested in how their company is going to succeed. I hope I am one of those lucky few.  My life has had many highs and lows, but I live by these dreams and values.  The other day I was taking to my wife about life, business, and relationships and I compared my life to a short bus.

      quote: "People are either on my short bus or off of it.  It’s a crazy ride that not everyone wants to ride on, no one rides for free, and not everyone at the final stop was there at the beginning."}

p
  |I understand that not everyone I encounter will be compatible with me, and I am ok with that.  I love my friends, and would take a bullet for my loved ones.

  |P.S.  I will leave you with one final example.  If you are a programmer working in relaxed fortune 500 corporate 9-5 job in a computer language that isconsidered obsolete, and you are not working 24hrs a day to up your chops, do not be surprised by the meteor that lands on you.  The dinosaurs did not see it coming either.
