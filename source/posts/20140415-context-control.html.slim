  |Everything from your likes, your photos, and basically your entire entity is owned by a corporation.  It took me a long time to come to this conclusion but basically I am saying fuck you to facebook. I’m done.  Today I closed my account. Was this a rash decision? No. I have been considering this for quite some time now.  One of my favorite sayings is “min-maxing constantly.”  If you do not know what that means, google it.  Over time I have started to wonder how much value various services and various connections in those services truly matter to me.  Would I invite each and every connection into my home for a private meal?  What really matters?  In life you only have so much time.  Time is the one thing as humans we all have in common, and I do not believe in wasting it.

  |When I wrapped up the most recent rollouts to my business, I wanted to tackle my blog.  I wanted to regain full control of what was shared and who owned it.  At the same time, I have drastically cut down on the senseless noise around me.  Have you ever wondered how many of the loudest people are also the most unsuccessful?  Do I really give 2 shits about your dogs, your kids, people I will never see again except in passing?  Are single serving friends worth the extra effort? After dumping facebook, I completed a full purge across each my contacts.  Other services, such as LinkedIn, already direct traffic here.   Am I leaving all of social media? No. I have always enjoyed the interactions on twitter and especially instagram.  I tend to follow a broad spectrum of folks across many different industries.  The interactions feel more natural and are for more entertaining compared to the youtube like comments on facebook.  Hell, I met my wife through twitter.  At the end of the day, I think the communities are just plain different.  I have to admit, this inspiration did not just fall out of the damn sky.

  |A recent #{link_to("This Week in Startups", "http://thisweekinstartups.com/", target: "_blank")} podcast with #{link_to("Marc Cuban", "http://thisweekinstartups.com/mark-cuban-kick-ass/", target: "_blank")} covered the concept of controlling context. For the sake of simplicity, I will avoid going into a diatribe on how internet bullying is not only destructive but extremely dangerous to our society. I will mention that I have always been ok with pissing off others.  While I do not go out of my way or do it intentionally, I understand that trying to please everyone in life results in complete failure.  If you read my rants you already understand many of my opinions.  I will miss various interactions on that platform but what I will not miss are the rampant ignorant conversations, especially the blow ups during elections.  I will not miss the lost time spent trying to argue with unintellectual  brainless drones about how distorted their backwards view of the world may be.  Were there other options? Yes. I could have gone through and removed myself from groups, unshared photos, removed friends, etc. That would have taken more time and resulted in private messages asking why? How dare you? So I decided to go with who the fuck cares.  Burn it.  Time means more to me.  For some people the only way to kill something is to remove all associations to it.  So instead of just promising myself I would cut down interactions, stop posts, etc. I decided to make the cut.  This is no different than buying chocolate chip cookies and saying you are only going to eat one a week.  Yeah that lasts.  The other rebuttal will be, what about self control.  True.  That is a great point, but see my earlier point.  Fuck the noise.  When you truly focus on what you want in life, very few other things really truly matter.

  |So ask yourself, what matters to you?  Could that time you spend fat and laying on the couch spoon feeding nonsense into your brain be better spent elsewhere?  Why do you think Facebook or products like it are any fucking different from soap operas? It’s the same fucking crack.  Before you jump all over me, know this, I believe in social networks and platforms.  They have a solid purpose, but I favor micro networks over macro.

p
  |A well tailored service can be both very entertaining and beneficial to a customer and the content provider.  I believe they are worth paying and charging for.  While favor may rise and fall for a given platform the huge macro networks will never go away.  The larger they get, the more power they give to the smaller indie based networks who can truly tailor their products and services to a set of customers.  Customers who make a choice where to spend their priceless time.  Customers who think for themselves.

  |If you want to connect with me, check my social logins.  I am not tied to any particular set of services and I reevaluate all the damn time.  I hope you do the same thing in life, because each second can never be reclaimed.
