  | I have heard many people say that you can get the same value out of a conference by watching it on tv or a screencast after the big show. To be honest with you, I think that’s completely b.s. Would the same people say they get the same value out of watching the pyramids on The Discovery Channel versus seeing them in person? I highly doubt it. I have attended numerous conferences in my past and can say without a doubt that coughing up the money for the entrance fees is well worth it. If your company does not pay for it, save for it like I did.

  |This was my first Rails Conference and it was the best conference I have attended by far. The sheer number of geeks at the sold out show was impressive, and overall it was the most diverse out of any I have previously attended. I attended numerous talks in my <a href="/2013/04/28/my-first-rails-conference/">conference schedule</a> and only a few were lackluster. I met a lot of people that are now in my digital rolodex both inside and outside the speaking sessions and the many evening events. It made for a killer week. I also was able to sit front row for the #{link_to("dhh", "https://twitter.com/dhh", target: "_blank")} keynote. Before I get into my topic takeaways I must highlight a few things.

  |If you are considering <a href="/2013/05/06/constant-learning/">learning to code</a>, now is the time. There are so many startups looking for you to join great teams. The number of businesses expanding in rails is astronomical, and the conference job board was literally packed with numbers and emails to call. Second, I only counted 10, literally 10 PCs out of the sold out 1500+ attendees. While this was reported on our #irc channel, I in fact only saw one, and that one, sadly, was running windows. I must admit I shed a tear for that poor soul. I have battled the Windows die hard crowd so many times over the course of my career being the only Apple user in a sea of PCs at my day gigs. Here though, I felt at home.

  |Enough of the MSFT trolling, here are few of my topic takeaways.

  |I learned quite about about APIs and tackling scalability. As I continue to work on my startup in the evenings, scalability and the issues surrounding it have been a concern. I no longer worry about it. One of the consistent messages baked into the rails and ruby communities is code is disposable. We do not have to stick to it like glue! So build fast, build what your customers want, track where your bottlenecks are, and appropriately fix those bottlenecks when required. You do no need to setup an expensive #{link_to("heterogeneous", "http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/44213/heterogeneous-environment", target: "_blank")} #{link_to("system architecture", "http://blog.maxindelicato.com/2009/01/heterogeneous-vs-homogeneous-system-architectures.html", target: "_blank")} day one if you have not tested what your customers will want. A #{link_to("homogeneous", "http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/44332/homogeneous-environment", target: "_blank")} system may work just fine. Make sure you are not wasting your money, time, and resources. #{link_to("Learning from Jony Ive, Orwell, and the Kano", "https://gist.github.com/naoyamakino/5505375", target: "_blank")} was an amazing talk, and if you are not familiar with the 5 basic principles of an API check out that talk, but most importantly, watch #{link_to("Objectified", "http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/", target: "_blank")}. Compared to working in other languages I enjoyed the talks on naming conventions, proper structure, and overall code simplicity. I agree that code should be self documenting, easy to read, easy to adapt, however, it does not need to last forever. Even the best systems or code blocks are replaced. That is the nature of software evolution. My favorite session was “#{link_to("How to Talk to Developers by Ben Orenstein", "http://www.justin.tv/confreaks/c/2250625", target: "_blank")}." Watch it. It was hilarious.

  |While I only highlighted a few of my takeaways, I learned something in every session I attended. I have been learning ruby and rails for sometime now and I continue to look forward to learning more and more in the ruby community. I hope to see you at #{link_to("Ruby Conference", "http://rubyconf.org/", target: "_blank")} in Miami.
