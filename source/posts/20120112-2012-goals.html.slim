  |Instead of the plain old yearly goals that everyone outlines for the future, every new year, I started thinking about themes and what means the most to me in 2012. &nbsp;What can I change now, starting now, today. &nbsp;I have come to understand and accept my past, learn from it, grow from it, but not let it hold me back. &nbsp;I am not afraid to tell others what I feel, even if it's not what they want to hear. &nbsp;I have grown to accept the fact that pleasing everyone is truly impossible, and being a&nbsp;chameleon is b.s. &nbsp;&nbsp;When you set out to start a company, sail a ship, buy a one way ticket you have to have a set of parameters to guide you, yet, not restrict you so much there are no alternatives. &nbsp;Since I have left Chicago, life has been a roller coaster to say the least. &nbsp;There have been ups and downs, but I still do not regret taking my first steps on the path away from where I grew up. &nbsp;The nervousness has since subsided, but the excitement hasn't. &nbsp;The friends I have met on my journey outside of Chicago have quickly become part of the chosen family I hope to have forever, and the plans I have made with the love of my life Kathryn warm my heart. &nbsp;So what's next? I think of this all the time. &nbsp;Yes, there are many things brewing in the kitchen - have to say this for our stalkers. &nbsp;But focusing on themes, I have locked in three for me:
  strong
    |Think
  |,&nbsp;
  strong
    |Create
  |,&nbsp;
  strong
    |Act.&nbsp;
  |Yes, they are a little broad, but after quite a few sessions on the treadmill I was able to narrow down my focus to these three.

  |This year I want to dive deeper into&nbsp;Buddhism, learn more about the spiritual journey, it's a piece of me that I have grown to appreciate the more I dive in. &nbsp;Directly related to this spiritual&nbsp;initiative&nbsp;is what I call being more "zen" or the "water flowing through rocks." &nbsp;Working and living in a major city like Chicago or Manhattan, comes with stress, plain and simple. If you have ever lived in a major city, you know what I am referring to. &nbsp;No, I am not going into the rants now, I will save them for later, but they are easy to list. &nbsp;While you can not control others, you have full control over your reactions to others' behaviors or lack there of. &nbsp;I have come to learn and actively practice not letting much get to me. &nbsp;Life is just too short to be stressed right? &nbsp;If you follow me on twitter, you just read this and was like "yeah right" but acknowledge this, there is a big difference between rants {tweets} and the movements you make every day in life just walking down the street, holding the door for your elderly neighbor, and helping a child get a drink off the coffee shop counter.

  |I enjoy working in coldfusion, but to be honest. I am creative. &nbsp;I have started learning Ruby and Rails this year and have been focusing more on UIE. &nbsp;As my wife has taken the leap into learning how to code, I will be spending time &nbsp;on a journey I call back to the basics. &nbsp;I am planning on going through the same set of Treehouse tasks she has been going through. &nbsp;I figure a solid refresher, no matter how long you have been coding can't hurt. &nbsp;Plus, there are always things that you have been doing, sometimes for years, incorrectly in terms of coding architecture and principles. &nbsp;I want to write more in 2012, not for you, but for me. &nbsp;While I would welcome an audience to read my craziness, I want to be open with myself, be authentic, and put it out there on paper. &nbsp;Don't care if I get signed for a book. &nbsp;It's for me. Enjoy.

  |I have made a commitment to kill off my fat stomach. &nbsp;No, I do not have body image issues, but health and fitness are huge priorities in my life. &nbsp;I like being tone, fit, and that means it has to go. &nbsp;Luckily we live a very holistic lifestyle and are probably one of the only families who actually cook at home in Manhattan. &nbsp;While I may never get a 6 pack, shedding about ten pounds would make me very happy. &nbsp;Being married to a personal trainer has it's perks and have already put on a significant amount of muscle mass breaking through markers on squats, shoulder presses, and even simple things like dips. &nbsp;Yet, being the type-a person I am, I have quite a ways to go.

  |I will expand on these as make my way through this year, and to be honest with you, this year's plans already make me beyond excited. &nbsp;What do you think? Think I am crazy? &nbsp;I hope you do. &nbsp;Keep on fighting, keep on learning, keep on kicking ass and taking names.
