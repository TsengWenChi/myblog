  |When my wife and I left Manhattan to head back West we moved to PDX completely blind. Neither of us had lived or visited there, but from our research everything seemed to fit.  To be absolutely honest, we watched too much Portlandia.

  |During our first summer fest we stumbled upon the brand #{link_to("CAR2GO", "http://car2go.com", target: "_blank")}, a new car share service to the city.  Neither of us owned automobiles and we had planned on primarily using public transportation and purchasing bicycles.  I had used #{link_to("Zipcar", "http://zipcar.com/", target: "_blank")} in Boulder, and I was a bit skeptical on their pricing and parking options, but #{link_to("CAR2GO", "http://car2go.com", target: "_blank")} seemed very reasonable.  At the fest #{link_to("CAR2GO", "http://car2go.com", target: "_blank")} brought two of their little go carts for people to review and they had a raffle wheel you could spin to get free starter minutes. As luck would have it, I ended up rolling the highest free minute slice of the wheel that day.  I signed up for my membership that same week, and we have been hooked ever since. So why I am writing this letter?  Just like any proud super fan would do, the answer is feedback.  I regularly reply to each of the surveys they send me, but I wanted to expand on something further.  A concept that I feel could help their system.  An idea that I would love to see developed.  A potential fix for what I call <em>dead zones in the play pen</em>.

  |For those unfamiliar with #{link_to("CAR2GO", "http://car2go.com", target: "_blank")} the play pen is what I call the geographical area inside of the operating home zone.  Basically, this it the zone that represents anywhere you can end a rental.  The go carts, or "#{link_to("Smart Cars", "http://smartusa.com/", target: "_blank")},” navigate around this pen at random with no referee to make sure the number of cars remains evenly dispersed throughout the pen, preventing tight clusters.  The result of no oversight is what I refer to as dead zones.  Dead zones can occur throughout the pen at various times of day, as a result of a major event such as big game or conference, or an area that does not see that much traffic overall.  In the current system and corresponding rental software in the car there does not appear to be a way to prevent this from happening.  In fact, it is often quite predictable depending on where  you live.  To prove my point, just review the #{link_to("CAR2GO", "http://car2go.com", target: "_blank")} iPhone application each night for a week and you will see where clusters tend to form and where dead zones regularly occur.  While #{link_to("CAR2GO", "http://car2go.com", target: "_blank")} prides themselves on a fixed pricing system, no parking fees, park nearly anywhere, etc.  this issue can be solved.  They do not need parking spots like #{link_to("Zipcar", "http://zipcar.com/", target: "_blank")} or #{link_to("Getaround", "http://Getaround.com/", target: "_blank")}. They need an organic dynamic ai based referee.

  |So what is the referee?  In theory the referee would be software that continuouly monitors the grid to prevent clusters from occurring, or at least encourages users to prevent clusters themselves.  How does it achieve this goal?  Intelligent based discounting.  Take a look at the attached image.  Let’s say for a minute zone 1 is low on rentals.  Since the referee is monitoring the grid it can credit drivers who end rentals in the zone that  needs vehicles.  The overall pricing model does not change, but it gives a slight benefit to those willing to help out others.  Cost based incentives are proven to work.  There are users that regularly fill up cars will fuel just to get the minute credits.  Personally, I have never filled up a rental with gas yet.  While I would avoid the gas station, I would love to walk an extra few bucks to balance the grid.  Would the credits and zones be fixed? No.  The referee would adjust the zones to fit supply and demand and the credits should vary by time of day.  Peak times would have less of credit because the volume crossing paths in the grid should come close to balancing it, but at off peak the credits would be higher.  As an avid #{link_to("CAR2GO", "http://car2go.com", target: "_blank")} user, and programmer, I believe this can be accomplished.  Expensive? Maybe, but a well balanced system driven by pure supply and demand should yield more rentals and more profits long term.  Also, customer satisfaction will improve because of availability.  I know it would make us happier, especially in the zone we live in.

  |If you read this #{link_to("@CAR2GO", "http://twitter.com/car2go", target: "_blank")}, let me know what you think... I will be attaching this thread to every survey you send me.  I think this spec can work.  Thank you for providing such an amazing service.
