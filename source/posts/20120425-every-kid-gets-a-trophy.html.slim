  |I have been working as a code monkey ever since I left college.&nbsp; I learn visually but can handle straight text when I need to, and I would like to think that I am not design inept.&nbsp;

  |A hefty goal of mine this year is to work hard to master #{link_to("Ruby", "http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/", target: "_blank")} and the #{link_to("Ruby on Rails", "http://rubyonrails.org/", target: "_blank")} framework.&nbsp; My traditional experience told me to find a class first, however, after listening to numerous recommendations from #{link_to("This Week in Startups", "http://www.thisweekinstartups.com/", target: "_blank")} and #{link_to("This Week in Web Design", "http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-web/", target: "_blank")} I started out online.&nbsp;

p
  |For this experiment I pretended to start from scratch as though I had no prior programming or design experience.&nbsp; I knew I would tackle more than just Ruby classes, but I wanted to experience all of it first hand. I started with #{link_to("Code School", "http://www.codeschool.com/", target: "_blank")}, #{link_to("Treehouse", "http://teamtreehouse.com/", target: "_blank")}, and #{link_to("Code School", "http://www.codecademy.com/", target: "_blank")}. I know there are quite a few out there but I feel these three cover a good number of core competencies. Or, at least they claim to. I also wanted to test the theory I have been hearing others say that &ldquo;college is just not required anymore.&rdquo;&nbsp; I started this experiment at the first of the year, with the initial hypothesis that &ldquo;college is necessary for coding and design.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me break down each of the three online options I used.&nbsp;
p
  |#{link_to("Codecademy", "http://www.codecademy.com/", target: "_blank")} is the cheapest of the three. It&rsquo;s free. It also has the most functional design.&nbsp; Some users may be turned off by this, the same way they would be opening a math book.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s primary focus is javascript, but they recently started offering some css and html courses.&nbsp; Being a coder, I enjoyed the code samples and the logical progression through the course.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t any fluff. No videos.&nbsp; No music.&nbsp; Just code.&nbsp; If you are setting out to learn javascript and jquery I would advise you to take every course available here first.&nbsp; You will learn javascript, not every piece of it, but you will get a solid base.&nbsp;
p
  |#{link_to("Treehouse", "http://teamtreehouse.com/", target: "_blank")} definitely has the most &ldquo;fluff&rdquo; out of the three and by far the most content, however, it is also the most expensive.&nbsp; If you are truly new to technology you will enjoy the videos, music, and multiple choice tests.&nbsp; The lack of true coding examples and tests keeps me from recommending it ahead of #{link_to("Code School", "http://www.codeschool.com/", target: "_blank")}.&nbsp; Overall I would say #{link_to("Treehouse", "http://teamtreehouse.com/", target: "_blank")} would be best for designers transitioning into coding, but it will not in it&rsquo;s current state give you all of the necessary tools to complete that transition. You will need the other two for sure.&nbsp; In terms of the design basics like layout or color theory I thought the topics were thoroughly covered. &nbsp;
p
  |#{link_to("Code School", "http://www.codeschool.com/", target: "_blank")} won me over completely the moment I opened the &ldquo;Try Ruby&rdquo; course.&nbsp; The site has an excellent blend between videos, music, and writing code.&nbsp; While it does not have as much content as #{link_to("Treehouse", "http://teamtreehouse.com/", target: "_blank")}, I have to say that #{link_to("Code School", "http://www.codeschool.com/", target: "_blank")} takes a more in depth approach to learning.&nbsp; Outside of their courses they also have hours of video content available on a variety of subjects.&nbsp; If you ask me, if you are brand new, start with #{link_to("Codecademy", "http://www.codecademy.com/", target:"_blank")} &amp; #{link_to("Code School", "http://www.codeschool.com/", target: "_blank")}. &nbsp;

p
 |I would like to think that learning online has come a long way. Sadly, I have to say it still has a way to go before it can replace classroom learning for technical subjects completely.&nbsp; Yes, you learn the basics. However online learning will not give you that in depth perspective, and definitely not the community aspect of working along side your peers in the same room. &nbsp;

p
  |At the end of the day I ended up signing up for a course at #{link_to("NYU on Ruby on Rails", "http://www.scps.nyu.edu/course-detail/INFO1-CE9970/20121/ruby-on-rails/", target: "_blank")} and I am glad I did.&nbsp; By combining the online courses from #{link_to("Code School", "http://codeschool.zferral.com/l/98/71262", target: "_blank")} and the traditional experience in the class room I feel will be able to start building things in Ruby after the course.&nbsp; No, I will not be a pro by any means, but I have the tools to start,&nbsp; and have networked with fellow mentors to keep the learning process going.&nbsp; Networking is not the only area where online learning breaks down.

p
  |The #{link_to("Treehouse", "http://teamtreehouse.com/", target: "_blank")} tests were beyond easy to game, and no matter how many times you failed a question you can just keep guessing until you passed. #{link_to("Codecademy", "http://www.codecademy.com/", target: "_blank")} &amp; #{link_to("Code School", "http://www.codeschool.com/", target: "_blank")} handled this best by making the user submit code examples to progress to the next session, however, you still have access to google and #{link_to("Stack Overflow", "http://stackoverflow.com/", target: "_blank")} to cheat your way through.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s not pretend people do not cheat.&nbsp; In order for learning to be effective there has to be failing grades, markers to force people to start over.&nbsp; The carrots or badges are great, but what do they truly represent?

      quote: "Would you hire someone based on the number of badges they have?"}

p
  |I keep hearing people questioning if college is necessary, and backing up those claims with sites like these, or the fact they are already running a startup with only their high school diploma.&nbsp; Still, college degrees are still valid and in many cases required.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not to say that there are not winning lottery tickets out there who have success, it&rsquo;s not the norm.&nbsp; This is not an attack on them at all.&nbsp; I am happy it worked out for them.&nbsp; To me, it&rsquo;s like taking all of your savings and buying lottery tickets with it. &nbsp;
p
  |School teaches more than coding, it teaches interpersonal skills, communication, time management, and how to interact with others to name a few.&nbsp; My wife and I plan on having a family soon and schooling, especially the type of schooling, is a top most priority.&nbsp; I am often asked what about college as I am the only programmer in my immediate family.&nbsp; Here is where a good blend of reasoning comes in.&nbsp; Does it make sense to buy the lotto ticket and avoid college all together? No.&nbsp; It also does not make sense to stay 100% in the classroom with no real world experience.&nbsp; In my opinion you need a blend.&nbsp; I would advise our children to complete college over the course of 4-6 years blended with coding, online learning, and working at startups full time.&nbsp; People need to know how to talk, how to interact with others, especially members of the opposite sex in the workplace.&nbsp; They need to learn just how bad the &ldquo;brogramming&rdquo; experience really is and why they shouldn&rsquo;t recreate it.&nbsp; Having a broad scope of knowledge across a variety of technical and non-technical subjects helps prevent creating a horse in central park with blinders on.&nbsp; It also, helps them be a better leader and less likely to be taken advantage of by others. &nbsp;
p
  |Call me crazy, but school still wins my vote.&nbsp; Until the online sites actually give failing grades and better report card like metrics, they are not going to replace the classroom experience completely.&nbsp; Instead of thinking every kid gets a trophy, maybe we should consider the fact that we are all different.&nbsp; Not everyone will be a coder or designer, just like not everyone can play sports.&nbsp; If you or a child is horrible at baseball, try basketball, try football, or do whatever you feel you can do best.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re are always awarded trophies and badges you will not know what you are actually proficient at.&nbsp;
