  |Recently I have been pondering real value as it relates to startups.&nbsp; What are startups actually producing?&nbsp; How long will these technologies last?&nbsp; I wanted to take one of my favorite quotations and wrap it around topics that we startup geeks and entrepreneurs would love. &nbsp;
/! more
p
  |Every day there are more and more incubators coming online and more and more new startups being released into the wild.&nbsp; Without sounding too cryptic, I often ask myself what value are many of these companies adding? Do they care?&nbsp; The companies of our parents and grandparents were built to last for generations. I question how long many of the startup companies today will be around. &nbsp;
p
  |Building a company is tough. It takes more than just words.&nbsp; I am no longer interested in bragging about what I am working on. I would rather take that time to produce and let my work speak for itself.&nbsp; I believe in building brands that last the test of time.&nbsp; The great companies of today were not successes overnight and they lasted generations because they continued to focus on innovation, new products, and a solid brand.&nbsp; I love technology but I truly detest how short sighted many people are.&nbsp; If you ask me, wasting my time building a company to flip is no different than flipping condos.&nbsp; I would rather set out to disrupt an industry and stick with it until all options have been exhausted.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I am not saying to put all of your eggs in one basket. An average type-A person can have a ton of complex investments running concurrently.&nbsp; I am saying I prefer to build something of value.&nbsp;
p
  |When I look at a few of my favorite brands outside of technology sector like Dewalt, Berkshire Hathaway, Mercedes, or even Katz Deli in NYC, they have lasted for generations.&nbsp; They are places were fathers and daughters work together and they have a respected, sought after culture. They are recognized globally, and they provide real value. &nbsp;
p
  |When I work on a product, I ask myself which category I want my company to fall into: Reason, Season, or Lifetime.&nbsp;
p
  |Reason companies are often called &ldquo;Feature&rdquo; companies, designed around a single task, or small set of tasks, waiting to get acquired.&nbsp; They may or may not shoot for hockey stick like growth, but they will not last on their own. &nbsp;
p
  |Season companies come into the markets, disrupt a sector, usually have hockey stick like growth, than either fizzle out or get acquired for a much cheaper valuation. &nbsp;
p
  |Lifetime based companies last the test of time.&nbsp; They represent a set of products, or entire platform, may or may not have venture capital, and may be publicly traded.&nbsp; Another key factor in determining where a company falls is just how much impact they will have to the world.&nbsp; Easier said than done.&nbsp;&nbsp;
p
  |I was once told that how wealthy you are can be determined by the following formula: How long can your family, your children, your children's&lsquo; children and so on live at the same level as you today, without working.&nbsp;<span class="s2">I hope to build products and companies that last so that when I kick the bucket, I actually accomplished something.&nbsp;
p
  |If you&rsquo;re building a technology company, build a strong foundation.&nbsp; Focus on your vision, your product, where you are going, and ignore the fucking scenesters.&nbsp; Build a strong advisory board of close friends, not just people who hang on you.&nbsp; You will work a good portion of your life so make sure it happens in the location you want it to, not where someone else or incubator tells you to.&nbsp; Money will flow to where it&rsquo;s replicated the easiest, and even in these markets many of my Chicago trader friends are killing it for this exact reason.&nbsp; You can get capital outside of the valley or NYC if just work your ass off.&nbsp; Most of what I have said isn&rsquo;t news, it&rsquo;s a conversation I have been having in my head.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my beliefs on business on paper.
p
  |Am I being too traditional with my thinking? Is this just not possible in technology?

  |One of my favorite sayings from an unknown author:

      author: "Unknown",\
      quote: "People come into your life for a&nbsp;<strong>REASON</strong>, a <strong>SEASON</strong> or a <strong>LIFETIME</strong>.<br/><br/>When you know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person. &nbsp;When someone is in your life for a <strong>REASON</strong>, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend and they are. &nbsp;They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on anyone's part or at an inconvenient time, this person or you will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. &nbsp;What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move on.<br/><br/>Some people come into your life for a <strong>SEASON</strong>, because your turn has come to share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make youlaugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it, it is real.&nbsp;Yet only for a season. &nbsp;<br/><br/><strong>LIFETIME</strong> relationships teach you lifetime lessons, things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. &nbsp;Lifetime relationships can run continuously, or for many, on again, off again. &nbsp;Your job is to also accept that life may have its ebbs and flows, but time and distance apart does not have to define a relationship."}
