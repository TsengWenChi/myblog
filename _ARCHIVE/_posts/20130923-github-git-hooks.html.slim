<p>
Recently I spent a small chunk of time exploring what I could do with git hooks.  My goal was to append a message on every
commit with the correct git hub url to it's corresponding commit url at git hub.  This was no easy feat from what I discovered
and I definitely lost a few hairs over it. In the end, I took on the battle and won.<!-- more -->  If you have been following my
{% link https://github.com/chrishough/myconfigurations "Coder Setup" %} these are three files that are included in my bundle.
</p>
<p>First the git cloning utility properly setups the cloned repo and installs each hook.</p>
<p>{% gist 8092445 clone.sh %}</p>
<p>This commit-msg hook automatically adds the branch name and branch description to every commit message.</p>
<p>{% gist 8092445 commit_msg_add_branch_name.sh %}</p>
<p>This post-commit hook automatically adds a note to each commit with the correct github url.</p>
<p>{% gist 8092445 post_commit_add_github_commit_note.sh %}</p>
