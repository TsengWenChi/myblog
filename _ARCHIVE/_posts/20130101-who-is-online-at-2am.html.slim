<p>There are an endless number of posts out there giving their perspective on what it takes to be an entrepreneur, how to run a startup, how to succeed, and all of that crap we heard from Tony Robbins.&nbsp; Once you announce you&rsquo;re doing something in the tech world, &nbsp;the hangers come out of the woodwork from all around you.&nbsp; The hardest to avoid are your close friends and family. I have never had a problem separating business from my personal life, and after a recent experience with a close friend and family member, I wanted to outline our world. This is a blog post about being deep in the mud taking grenades that we could point our close friends and family members to before they begin working on their "this could be the next Facebook" idea.&nbsp; If you have read this far, you must think you have the balls to try something new and&nbsp;succeed.&nbsp;

 First before reading anything farther, I want you to {% link http://youtu.be/lsSC2vx7zFQ "watch this video" %}.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of my favorite lines from this clip is &ldquo;I am here to tell you that most of you want to be successful, but you don&rsquo;t want it bad, you just kinda want it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Success is earned.&nbsp; You have to want it bad, each and every minute of every day.&nbsp; In some cases it&rsquo;s the only reason you may be alive today.&nbsp; You WILL NOT SLEEP.&nbsp; If this bothers you, turn around and run away. Let&rsquo;s be honest, this bus ride is not for everyone.&nbsp; At the end of the day, I am ok with that.&nbsp; We live in one of the greatest countries in the world, and if you want it, you can go out and get it.&nbsp; It will not be easy, and most fail in the process.&nbsp; I am tired of the people who look at the person driving the Bentley and saying, &ldquo;oh he or she must be cheating, must be a trust fund kid, etc.&rdquo; Who fucking cares? Why do you care? My father always taught me to work as hard as I could at everything I set out to do, regardless of what others thought.&nbsp; If they are in your way, run them over, not everyone is meant to sit at same table in your house.&nbsp; You get to choose who those close advisors are. Make sure you pick wisely.&nbsp; You may be reading this and thinking &ldquo;Chris only cares about money!&rdquo;&nbsp; If you are thinking this, than stop reading this, find something better to do with your time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not about money, it&rsquo;s about enjoying the journey, the stress, the sacrifice, the time, it&rsquo;s about not sleeping. I recently watched this {% link http://youtu.be/UxjCzSP30wM "video about a bad ass named Kai Greene" %}. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One of his messages, blew me away.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is IT? That other people have that other people seemingly don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had to pause to think about this myself.&nbsp; I am not sure I even know the answer. I hope I will in time. Until that day, I will keep my head down, avoiding the grenades and fighting as hard as I can. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So if this vision still means something, and you are not too scared, let me give you a few tips.&nbsp; I have always been a huge believer in what you feed your mind defines where you will go.&nbsp; This list is not comprehensive. I am sure there a ton of important links I am leaving off, but these links mean the most to me. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To the family members, friends, and inquiring contacts I forward this to: Before you present your next greatest idea you thought of in the bathroom, ask yourself how bad do you want it? Have you done your homework? It&rsquo;s not impossible to learn to code. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are you online at 2am? &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you can check these off, let&rsquo;s meet, if not, remember I am taking grenades in the trenches and may not have the time to hold your hand or draw you a visual diagram.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be offended. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Cheers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
