<p>
Recently we canceled our crossfit membership, however as part of my <a href="{% post_url 2013-01-21-my-2013-goals %}">2013 goals</a> I am requiring myself to shed at least 30lbs.  Crossfit was just not cutting
it and the cost to benefit ratio, in my honest opinion, wasn't balanced.  After literally spending time in each gym around our home we moved to join 24 hour fitness and haven't looked back.  As I have
previously outlined in <a href="{% post_url 2012-09-16-programmers-are-fat %}">Programmers Are Fat</a> fitness is a priority for me, however, I battle with food constantly.  Starting this weekend we are going on a
liver cleanse combined with a reduction in overall calorie intake and the types of meat we will consume.  In a nut shell, drastically shifting to more vegetables with a daily protein shake and vitamin regiments. This is
the new workout my wife put together for me for the start of the 2nd quarter.  I hope this workout, combined with increased cardio and stricter diet helps me get over the recent struggles I have
been having with maintaining a strict diet. <!-- more -->
