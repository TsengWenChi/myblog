<p>
I am a certified health and fitness nut, and I have written about my journey quite few times.<!-- more -->  I
<a href="{% post_url 2013-08-30-september-197 %}">broke 197lbs</a> in the month of September, and I hope to drop even more this month.  
Unfortunately my diet has not been ideal so the October weigh in was flat at around 196lbs.  After serious consideration I
wanted to take on a 4 week challenge that would not only test my current strength limits, and my overall endurance, but it
would also challenge my current psychological barriers.  For the next 4 weeks I am teaming up with a buddy of
mine {% link http://twitter.com/tempelmeyer "Drew Tempelmeyer (@tempelmeyer)" %} and we are embarking on a quest to hit the gym
6 days a week for an Arnold Schwarzenegger style workout.  I have always been a huge fan of traditional style exercises
and the plan outlined below will be the most strenuous workout I have ever attempted.  I have purchased a stockpile of
supplements that includes additional protein shakes for pre-carb loading, intra workout shakes to maintain energy, and liquid vitamins.  
Outside of the {% link http://www.maxmuscle.com/ "Max Muscle" %} supplies I am going to restrict my diet from fatty foods and
significantly lower the amount of alcohol consumed this month.  Ideally I am pushing for no alcohol, and not going out to eat at
our favorite Portland restaurants.  I understand that  this workout will help push me towards my stretch goal of hitting 170lbs, and
that food is my greatest obstacle.

<p>
I am done fucking around with my diet and I want to fit back into the skinny jeans I bought in New York.  I know this will be difficult, but I am ready to take my fitness to the next level.

Help me stay honest!
