<p><strong>Health & Fitness</strong></p>
<p>To be honest with myself, I have been working out regularly at the gym but I have fallen
far short of my 30lb goal for this year.  What was the issue? I know what it was. I have the hardest time
controlling my fucking diet.  I love burgers and if see a food challenge on the menu, I order it just to devour it like a velociraptor.  I understand
what it takes to succeed at this goal, and I am recommitting.  Also to be completely honest, I have a stack of sexy skinny jeans from NYC that I want
to squeeze my ass back into.  Also, another component of fitness that people leave off is meditation.  Earlier in 2013 I was regularly attending hot yoga
sessions, and I plan on working that back into my routine.  It gives me time and space to think, which yields better results for my other themes for 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Startup</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the last few years my wife and I have pivoted our venture a few times into a few different market sectors, however, the
current direction has me more excited than ever.  Building businesses takes time, sacrifice, and hard work.  It has to be about more than money, and if you are like us
who prefer not to seek investment (bosses) until we have proven our concept works, it better correlate to your goals and values.  I love where I work during the day, and
our project we are grinding out in the cave in the evenings.  Nothing is guaranteed to succeed, but that is not what excites me.  We have already outlined the phases of
development this year and I believe at my core it will be successful.  I will be writing more about this initiative throughout the year, so stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Finance</strong></p>
<p>If you had a chance to read <a href="{% post_url 2013-09-28-co-founder-drama %}">co-founder drama</a> this year, you can only guess how much we wasted on legal bills.  While it
was a small set back, we were able to dig out of that hole.  During the process we did rack up a bit of credit card debt that I want to kill this year.  Also, we plan on paying off a series
of legacy debts that we have been chipping away at the last few years.  This ties in well with the first two themes, because I plan on being more of a ghost in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Communication & Leadership</strong></p>
<p>
  To my great friends, my heart goes out to you.  You know who you are, and you know I will always have your back. I have lived my life by a simple principle, "you're either on the bus, or
  off it, but no one rides for free."  The fancier way of stating this would be the "<a href="{% post_url 2012-04-29-reason-season-lifetime %}">reason, season, and lifetime</a>" philosophy.  Those
  who know me, understand my lovely lady is the quiet spoken rock behind my madness.  She has been assisting me in this process, and recommended the classic book {% amazon 0671027034 "How to Win Friends & Influence People" %}.  
  In my life, I have been referred to as a bull dozer, or bulldog, however, a single person can only go so far.  Teams work where lone wolfs fail. A group of dedicated mercenaries on the battlefield can outwit, out gun, and
  out maneuver even the smartest captains. This year, I want to keep my type-a personality and work ethic while building a team of smart, a players around me, so that we all lift each other up.
