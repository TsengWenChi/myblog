Dear conference and meetup organizers, small businesses, startup teams, and whomever else wishes to listen.

<strong><em>Can we move past the stereotypical pizza and beer events? </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
If you have ever wanted to lose weight, and found  yourself rushing to an evening meetup after work without time to grab dinner, you know what I'm talking about.  Event organizers,  this crappy food you are serving at your events is contributing to rising healthcare costs in our nation and making everyone sick and tired. Please rethink this strategy.  
</p>
<p>
If you are worried about alienating the developers and designers who are expecting pizza and beer thanks to years of social conditioning, that's ok.
</p>
<p>
At a minimum, please offer a snack table or meal option for those of us who want to keep it healthy.

I have attended events like these in every city I have lived in. To be honest, I am calling officer shenanigans on this bullshit.  By handing out pizza and cheap beer, you might as well be handing out free supersized fries and McDonalds cheeseburgers.  I mean, what's the difference?  Maybe a few of us geeks are concerned about the way we look, the way we fit into our clothes, the way we smell, the list goes on and on.  I know there are others out there with me that are sick of this broad stroke approach.  It feels amateurish and it's meant to appease the geek crowd.  Let’s face it, it’s just plain easy and cheap to just phone in twenty pizza hut gmo infested pizzas instead of going to the local grocery store or farmers market to pick up ingredients for a salad.

Yes there was a time in my life when this worked for me, but I am over it.  I am over the cheap beer and appetizers and honestly I would rather see geek events with healthy food, or at a damn minimum a healthy set of options free of GMOs, and free of high fructose corn syrup.  Is setting up a blender for fruit or veggie smoothies really hard?  While I am not in charge of an office, and no I do not run a meetup or conference I want to share these emotions with those that may.  Please consider this going forward.  How about we start talking about geek races, team events to the local rock climbing gym, or hell free gym passes.  Are there firms out there that already practice this? Of course, but many if not most, still just pass out pizza and beer.

Over my career I use to see the middle aisles of various corporations piled high with donuts, bottles of soda, and every assortment of treats you can think of.  I would watch people consume this garbage than sit down all day, and towards the end of the day get exhausted, tired, sugar rushes running down.  Most would complain of their weight, their looks, some depressed, than reach for another donut and head straight back to the cube.  I was one of those folks.  So if you have read this far, and you actually hear my plea, please consider a change.  
</p>
<p>
Please consider the folks that may be working hard to avoid the high fructose corn syrup infested soda, the gmo high carb pizza, and sugar packed ice cream.  These people are your friends, family, and co-workers.  They are working hard to have the bodies they want, not the prescribed American fatty diet the food corporations think we should have.  Trust me, it’s not that we do not want to eat that food, we do.  I have the same cravings you do, but I actually care what the numbers are on the scale.  Too long I have watched those numbers increase. Too long I have seen this occur.  I hope there are others out there that support this. I hope maybe at least one person thinks twice next time.  I live with this dream as I will continue to battle with food until the day I die.

I know I do not walk alone.
