<p>I know there are many variations for standing desk solutions online, but after tons of research, none of
them met my needs.<!-- more -->  Yes, I like {% link http://www.geekdesk.com/ "Geek Desks %} and {% link http://www.anthro.com/ "Anthro Carts %} but they
are way expensive and are pretty ugly.  I loved my old school tanker desk, especially for drawing so I needed something to adapt to it. While I am not a
huge fan of {% link http://www.ikea.com/us/en/ "IKEA %} they offered a great price to benefit ratio on my proposed configuration.  This cost me $25, not
counting labor.</p>
<p>Components required:</p>  
<ul>
  <li>$9.99 - {% link http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270/#/80104268 "LACK %} Side table, black-brown</li>
  <li>$14.99 - {% link http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20049538/ "CAPITA %} Leg, stainless steel</li>
  <li>Standard sized phillips screwdriver</li>
</ul>  
<p>{% img /content/standingdesk2.png %}</p>
<p>This configuration replaces the legs that come with the standard Lack side table reducing the overall height to just over 10 inches, plus there are really only
a few steps to complete this.  Merely turn over the lack table and install the 4 Capita legs.  Use a ruler if you wish to be precise, and it also helps to
pre-drill the holes.  Do not use a power drill to screw in the legs. TRUST ME, you WILL STRIP the cheap wood the furniture is made out of forcing you to
reposition the legs, or worse replace the entire table.  Down the road I am planning on acquiring an {% amazon B007PQXKA4 "anti-fatigue mat" %} to prevent knee
strain and help reduce back pain.</p>
<p>Here's my setup:</p>
