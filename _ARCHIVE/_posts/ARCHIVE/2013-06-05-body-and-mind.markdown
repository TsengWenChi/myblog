Working 90+ hours a week requires you to be in top shape, both mentally and physically.  While I have always battled my weight, I am happy to report that progress has been positive.  During
my last weigh in I was happy to see I dropped 6lbs. Although this is not even close to the 30lb total I am seeking to achieve, it’s better than nothing.

Starting in June my wife and I switched to a vegan diet.  Shocking coming from me right?  Being from the Midwest this has been extremely difficult for me, and I have only been successful
about 85% of the time.  By the end of this week we will have eliminated all of the items we had to purge in order to get to 100%.  Let me be straight with you, it sucks.  I walk by my
favorite meat producer each week at the farmers market and I hold my head in shame.  One of them came up to me and asked if they had done something wrong to lose our business.  I explained the situation and moved on.  While I am not opposed to eating meat, I have already started to notice I am far less bloated and I have not had to take prilosec nearly as often.

I lost 6lbs, so something must be working right?

One night after the gym, I felt so exhausted, almost empty.  I knew I was burring the candle at both ends and something had to be adjusted.  Outlined here is my latest
workout integrated with a new spiritual component.  When I lived in Boulder, Colorado I regularly attended hot yoga sessions and loved it.  Starting this week I reintegrated yoga back into
my workout routine.  Practicing shutting off your mind and focusing on the pains of stretching is not only good for your physical form, it also helps battle the demons inside your head.  While I will
not bore you with the battles that rage on in the circus of my mind, I will share that I enjoy the fights.  Many of my revelations in life have been experienced through physical pain and
meditation.  It’s always been how I able to reach peace.
