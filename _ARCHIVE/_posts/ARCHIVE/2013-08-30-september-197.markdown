I knew this month’s weigh in was not going to be the big win I had hoped for, but hell it’s a start.  I’m down a few pounds.
From July 1st until today I have started to see impressive gains in the amount of weight I can regularly left, speed at which
I can finish a super set, and the increased stamina I have been able to maintain.  It does go without saying I look like a
crazy wild animal and I scare the shit out of the clean cut Nike folks at our local 24hr fitness, but screw the haters.
Starting this month I am beginning to document each of the weight markers I obtain and set them appropriately for next month.
While I have not seen the rapid weight loss I had hoped to achieve, I know muscle weighs in heavier than fat.  I am slimming down.
Let’s be honest.<!-- more -->  My diet last month was not ideal.  I tried the vegan route, no dice, tried vegetarian, came close,
but at the end of the day I settled with 90/10.  I am going to eat meat and fish.  Humans have teeth for a reason.
While I may not buy the amount of products for the home I once did, I am no longer going to restrict myself from
cheeseburgers every once in a while.  Considering the average length of my workouts 1.5-2hrs 5-6x a week, I think
a little meat will not hurt me too much.  Lately I have converted to consuming 2 heavy protein shakes, one for
breakfast, the other for dinner, and a 400-600 calorie lunch.  The first week was brutal, but I immediately
started seeing results as of August 11th.  If you have been following my writing, I tend to change up my
workout plan frequently. I believe in muscle confusion, and this is my workout for the next month. I plan
to weigh in on October 1st.  So why do I keep fighting this battle?

This month so far I have been lucky enough to have a few moments of clarity amongst the startup life madness.  First, it’s the
Starbucks trenta size coffee.  Let me be clear, I detest going to Starbucks but it’s the only place open late by my house so
I am often trapped.   Every time I drop by I make the same mistake of asking for a large iced coffee and every time they
reach for the trenta.  I sit there, frozen, and think to myself who would possibly want to consume that monstrosity.
Not only do I have to correct them each time and size down to a normal human sized cup, but I have to ask them to not
sweeten it.  I mean, seriously, we need sugar in everything?  So over the last few months, I have started keeping
stats and asking the Starbucks employees if the cup purchased often corresponds to the size of the human consuming it.
While many just laugh, or slightly chuckle, I have noticed the same consistent response.  Yes.  I know they can not say
it, they would get fired, but late last week one brave soul gave me the answer my stats needed.  That brave soul will
be left nameless.  My second moment of enlightenment comes from a collection of threads I see randomly only almost each
and every day across the inter webs.

<p>
Time.  I have become convinced that any individual can make their day sound like it’s the busiest nightmare imaginable.
When did we become such fucking cry babies?  I’m sorry, but the occasionally shitty day does happen, trust me I have mine
frequently, but the assembly plant doesn’t stop.  I’m often up to 2am regularly, start a work day a few hours later,
manage to get laundry done, multiple meals, health and fitness goals, day career and startup night initiatives all
finished.  I watched my parents work their ass off for what they have as many of the people around them bitched and moaned.
I subscribe to that same mentality.  People wonder why 90% of the world’s wealth is controlled by 10% of the population.
Catch a clue.  Maybe they do not bitch, or whine about hard life is.  They are just like you and me, but they
make the choice to say fuck it, and fight.  I know I am not at the top yet, and I may never get there in my mind.  What
I do know is that I fight hard, play hard, and I will fucking die fighting.
