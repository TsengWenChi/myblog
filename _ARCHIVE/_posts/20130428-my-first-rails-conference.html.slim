When I left college, I never planned on being where I am  today.  I learned over time never to question these things, you only waste time.  
I have been programming in an old language called ColdFusion for very long time.  Yes, I get made fun of every time
I mention this to my fellow geeks, but what can I say, I love what I do. I would call myself software language
agnositic, however, on hardware I’m all Apple fanboy.  CF is a great language, it served its purpose just like
many others and I do not regret working in it during each day.  At night, however, I grok out to Ruby and Rails
in the darkness.  It makes me happy.  It excites me.  I have attended many of the great CF conferences over the
years including CFObjective and CFUnited and had a blast at each one.

I have been learning Ruby over the last year. I am bulding a startup in it.  While I have learned so much in
ColdFusion, especially from the community, I look forward to diving into my first Rails Conference and meeting
many of the leaders of Ruby on Rails community.  Once I got my first taste of the Ruby language I was hooked.  
I hope to meet many of you tomorrow. So if you see a geek with a fedora [hopefully there is not many of us] say
hello.  I am eager to meet you.
