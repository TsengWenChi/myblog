I started working in ruby on rails just over a year ago, and I was lucky enough to attend my first Rails Conference in my backyard of Portland, Oregon. <!-- more --> People who know me, know I am a huge fan of {% link https://twitter.com/dhh "@dhh" %} and the 37 Signals philosophy of building a business.  The opening day of the conference my buddy {% link https://twitter.com/tempelmeyer "@tempelmeyer" %} and I arrived before anyone else was there, even the setup crew.  We walked into the main auditorium and camped the front row.

<p>
Little did we know that we were not supposed to be in there that early, and the staff thought we were part of the first 2 special rows.  Once we discovered this, I thought to myself... “Well fuck it!”  I have always wanted to see a headliner like this.  Just like waiting for concert tickets, if you put in the time and get there first, you get the best seats in the house.  We were lucky.  Later my friend {% link https://twitter.com/vosechu "@vosechu" %} stopped by and asked us to hold the first two rows for his students as payment.  We gladly accepted the offer.

The keynote was fucking priceless!

A year has gone by and I am happy to be back in my hometown of Chicago for my 2nd Rails Conference.  Over the course of last year, I have started the foundations of a service orientated architecture written in rails 4 for my day gig.  Although I will save the juicy details of this battle for another post, I will say it has > 8 rails apis, built with chef + cap, running in the cloud, solr sidekiq, 100% test coverage, and soon to be postgres over sql server.  Outside of the day gig, at night I have launched multiple jekyllrb editorial sites 100% static hosted on S3 and the 0.1 release of the application my wife {% link https://twitter.com/kathrynhough "@kathrynhough" %} and I are building.  So what is on deck for this year?  I am planning on hitting my favorite Chicago restaurants and my schedule is posted below.  
</p>
<p>
Let’s meet up for beers, chat apis, or anything geek related.  I look forward to meeting everyone at the best  programming conference of the year.  
</p>
<p>
Cheers.
