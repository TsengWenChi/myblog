<p>
Carefully selecting which {% link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language "DSLs" %} to support in an organization, and which platforms to build on our crucial to its success. I am a huge supporter of open source projects and initiatives and hopefully these projects will save others a little bit of time.  If you find any bugs in my code please post a github issue and I will look into it asap.

<p>Outside of open source software I try to keep my eye out for solid <a href="/pages/kickstarter/">kickstarter</a> projects to back.</p>
<ul>
  <li>{% link https://github.com/chrishough/myconfigurations "my local configurations" %}<br/>The Hough Local Workstation Configurations.</li>
  <li>{% link https://github.com/chrishough/jquery-rails-google-cdn "jquery-rails-google-cdn" %}<br/>Use the Google CDN to serve jquery ui and fall back to the local version if the CDN is unreachable.</li>
  <li>{% link https://github.com/chrishough/jquery-ui-rails-google-cdn "jquery-ui-rails-google-cdn" %}<br/>Use the Google CDN to serve jquery and fall back to the local version if the CDN is unreachable.</li>
  <li>{% link https://github.com/chrishough/cdnjs-rails "cdnjs-rails" %}<br/>A mechanized way to pull in one to many CDNJS libraries with fall back to local installed versions.</li>
  <li>{% link https://github.com/chrishough/middleman-slim-foundation-emberjs-emblemjs "middleman-slim-foundation-emberjs-emblemjs" %}<br/>When I could not locate the stack I wanted, I built it. Examine the folders, gems, and included js files. It should include most of the base setup for a solid application.</li>
</ul>
